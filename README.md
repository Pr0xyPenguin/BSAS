# BSAS

Clustering users based on their movie preferences using Basic Sequential Algorithmic Scheme (BSAS). The dataset used can be found here https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/ . The only change you need to do in the dataset is to have the reviews in descending order based on the userid.
